# Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks

I can't publish all the research I've done for professor Kai Wang and his lab, but I can publish one seed that was used in accepted research paper. This notebook details the use of machine learning to reconstruct a random wigner function from the data which it's based off of. The goal is to successfully train a model to reconstruct complex functions into univariate ones which are simpler for researchers to understand, while still outputting the same wigner function.
